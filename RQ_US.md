RQ1 (Confirmatory): Does parent-child satisfaction and parental support during childhood predict current romantic relationship satisfaction?
RQ2 (Confirmatory): Does adult attachment mediate these associations?
RQ3 (Exploratory): What are the differences between American and Chinese samples in answering the first two research questions? 
RQ4 (Exploratory): How do different adult attachment dimensions play varied mediating roles across different cultural contexts and in comparisons between father-child and mother-child relationships?

# RQ1 for US
Use only US sample for answering RQ1. But I think itâ€™s convenient that I also analyze the chinse sample and put the results in the RQ3.

The mplus files are in Q1_US folder. I rerun some of the models using the new data (after scaling duration etc), found no difference in model fit or standardized coefficient.

The model is 3 predictors (each has it's indicators: 4+10+10), 7 covariates, 1 outcome (5 indicators). 36 obseved variables.

## Check the df of the hybrid model (get familiar with how mplus works, do not need this in regular research step)
I found in the mplus diagram, there are links between the covariates. I want to check the mplus results of the coviarates: make sure if the default setting is to estimate the corelations between the coviarates (there are real correlations) or it's just the problem of the mplus diagram (no correlations, but shows to have).
### Caculate the knowns and unknows based on my model (class 4 ppt)
measurement knowns:36*37/2 = 666

measurement unknowns:25 loadings(29-4) + 11 variances of constructs + 11*10/2 + 29 error variances = 120

measurement df=546

structrual knowns:11*12/2=66

structrual unknowns: 10 paths + 11 variances + 3 covariances between exo =24
structrual df=42

hybrid model df= 546+42=588

### find the real problem and fix it
The df based on the diagram is 567. I think the differences is about the structrual unknows: 10 paths + 11 variances + 24 covariances (in my model, it should be 3) between exo (3+7*6/2) =45. then the structrual df=21, so the hybrid model df= 546+21=567. 

It means that I need to rewrite the syntax so that it reflect my real model.

For the first try, I add commend to make sure the correlations between these covariances are set to 0, such as rela_sta WITH age@0; 
However, I do not know why, but the previous version did not correlate these observed variables to pcs, psf and psm, but now they did. Somehow it happened so I need to make these correlations to 0 as well.

For the second try, the df is 588 now. it works.

## test the hybrid model with all three predictors and all covariates (class4 p16)
### StepA: check if the measuement model consistent with the data & Step B: Revise the measurement model
df=546 chi2=1638
RMSEA=0.075 (0.05-0.10=accecptable fit) v
CFI 0.878 / TLI =0.859 (0.9-0.95=accecptable fit, a little bit low)
SRMR=0.042 (<0.08 =accecptable fit) v

Looks fine. Keep checking the normalized residuls and MI. (before that I have checked the factor loadings, looks fine: not <0.3 or >0.95;correlations between factors is not >0.85)

when I'm checking, I find another proplem: I need to tell mplus some binary variables are catigorical: CATEGORICAL = rela_sta ..After this, the model fits increase. But the method changed to WLSMV. Plus, in the output, there are threshold, gpt said "the thresholds you see are part of this IRT-based approach to handling binary and categorical variables." In fact, I found it might not be neccecery, since these categorical variables are not outcomes.

Check for Heywood cases (standardized loading is larger than 1 and the error variance is negative): looks fine

Check for empirical underidentification (lack of covergence orhuge standard eorrors): the only problem is since I use WLSMV, no standardized and normalized residuals are available. As I have scaled most variables, from checking the raw residual might be fine as well, however, it shows every residual is 0, I think there is problem, but I will leave it as is (might be fine in path model).

Check for MI, could correlate M1-F1 etc. After that, the CFI turns to 0.947. The respecification is pretty sucsess.
df 536 chi2=659
RMSEA 0.025
CFI 0.947
SRMR 0.051
Note, this is with the catigorical command (estimator is WLSMV), the measurement model fit without the command (so it's ML) is the same to the deleted paths model as follows.

I think to answer RQ1, it's better to keep both. For RQ 3, to compare, maybe delete is better.

## is using means ok compared to latent variables?
### Model with 2 covariates (RRS is latent. I tried RRS as mean, not work)
Model fit is ok for the model with 2 covariates (RRS is latent), and is very good for the one with one covariates (RRS is mean). For the first model, it's model fit is not good (RMSEA is bigger than 0.1). For the second model, the model fit is good, but the df is only 1, with R square only 0.329. Therefore, do not use the means.

# RQ3 part 1
## briefly check the differences with the old version Chinese data
Moel fit is fine.
rela_sta can imapct RRS, but the gender2 can not in this situation. COVID can, for Chinese. 
Need to change the covariates for further analysis.

## measurement invariance (MG-CFA. class 10 after p14)
PCS and RRS

Partial measurement invariance: Some factor loadings vary across groups; others do not.

Groups may differ in their variabilities in the common factor or the errors (check these AFTER the loadings), itâ€™s not necessary to have complete equivalence across all parameters to talk about measurement invariance.

I will use reference laten mean = 0 Approach (for the mean structure) and marker factor loading (fixed variance approach is not recommanded in MG method)

### Step 1: Unconstrained Common Model (Configural Model,freely estimate loadings, means/intervept, residual variances)
df=52=9*10/2*2-19*2(19 is the parameter it evaluate that I counted for each group). The df for the mean structure is 0 (for us,9-9, for china,9-9).

Do not need to free RRS with PCS, because it does not constrain them by default.

### step 3 partial (intercept)
Check if free some of the intercepts would make the model an acctepted one. When deciding which intercepts to free, I check the standardized residuals of the intercepts.

At first , I tried free R2, R4, R5, the chi2 is about 145, df=63.

Then, I tried free R2, R5, the chi2 is about 146.5,df=64.

At last, I tried only free R5, the chi2 is 153,df=65, seems like the chi2 difference test would be significant this time.

Using the rule for chi2 difference test, if two nested model is not significant different from each other, choose the more restrictive one (more df). Therefore, choose to free R2 and R5. Use this model from this step.

#### questions
1. why some standardized residual show 999, when there are respective normalized ones
2. why a standardized residual could be as big as 6, while the respective normalized one is onky about 1, which to follow?


### Step 4: Equality of residual variances (and covariances)
The chi2 turns to 500! Then I check the MI, decide try to free S1 S2. It still suggest to constain S3,S4, R1,R2,R4. I think it's just too much, meaning the residual variances is just different between groups.

#### note
This step is optional.
Not essential for multiple group analysis.
Important if you want to examine whether the reliability of measures is equivalent across groups.

### Step 5:  Equality of Factor (structural) means

Since the model in step 4 is optional and is not a good fit model, I will moderate based on the model in step 3 partial.

#### questions
1. The ppt does not say much, I guess I could just constrain the factor means in second group to be 0?
Yes. Confirmed by the class syntax.

2. I think the ppt said the means in the second group reflect the difference between these two groups?The results show huge difference, which did not seems right. I want to check.
These estimates are actually the relative differences on the factor means, as compared to the reference sample (in the metric of the marker variable). 

Means
    PCS                4.561      0.145     31.546      0.000
    RRS               -0.695      0.136     -5.105      0.000

Standadized means
Means
    PCS                2.582      0.161     16.046      0.000
    RRS               -0.529      0.107     -4.921      0.000
    
3. Then what is the marker variable (in the sentence "in the metric of the marker variable")? The ones constained to be equal across the groups?
In p 9, it said "Option 1: set the intercept of one of the variables = 0. This variable becomes the marker variable for the mean structure and so the latent mean is scaled in the metric of the marker variable.". BYW, option 1 is Fix the same indicator to be equal to 0 across the two groups.

To be honest, it is very confusing, I am using the option 2 (fix the mean of the latent variable to 0;Must have at least one intercept per factor constrained to be equal across groups), then how could the marker variable be the intercept=0 related variable? 

If so, which marker variable does it mean? The factor loading =1 related variable(indicator)? Is the metrics for factor loading the same to the means?

I asked chatgpt and she said "In SEM, the marker variable is typically the first indicator variable you list in your measurement model or the one for which you fix the factor loading to 1". I will just take this as the answer.

### Step 6:  Invariance of Factor Variances and Covariances (Steps 5 & 6 are interchangeable in terms of order)
Since the model in step 5 does not work, I use the model in step 3 partial 

#### step 6_1 Factor Variances
I tried to only constain the variance, but not works well: turns to be constain the standardised variance to 1 and make the correlation to be equal across two groups. By trying to fix this problem, I found 2 things.
1. Lacking ";" before the new commands, causing this problem.
2. The standardized latent variable variances would always be 1.

The model fit is fine, but the chi2 difference test would be significant (2 df more, but more than 100 chi2 increase).

#### step 6_2 factor covariances(Given equality of the factor variances, this test evaluates equality of the factor correlations)
It is said that this test is only meaningful if the loadings and the factor variances are invariant (c10 p23). Since Factor Variances are not equal, showed in the previous step 6_1, this step is not nececerry, just try (and write the model to be used in the future). 

Interstingly, constrain this correlation does not worsen the model fit.

# RQ3 part 2 MG-SEM (using multiple groups modeling on hybrid models; class 11 after p11)

MG-SEM involves all the measurement invariance steps used in MG-CFA as a part of evaluating the measurement model.

The only difference is that the measurement model includes the observed structural variables as well (we correlate all of our factors and observed structural variables just like in our normal hybrid model testing steps).

In the previous MG-CFA steps I did not include the observed structual variables. This time I will include sec and rela_sta (do not sure if I should include this)

## test for measurement part

### Step 1: Unconstrained Common Model (Configural Model)

#### With rela_sta (has warning) 

THE STANDARD ERRORS OF THE MODEL PARAMETER ESTIMATES MAY NOT BE
     TRUSTWORTHY FOR SOME PARAMETERS DUE TO A NON-POSITIVE DEFINITE
     FIRST-ORDER DERIVATIVE PRODUCT MATRIX.  THIS MAY BE DUE TO THE STARTING

     CONDITION NUMBER IS       0.168D-13.  PROBLEM INVOLVING THE FOLLOWING PARAMETER:
     Parameter 62, Group CHINA: [ RRS ]

     THIS IS MOST LIKELY DUE TO VARIABLE RELA_STA BEING DICHOTOMOUS BUT

In fact, constain all means almost did not worsen the model fit, just a little bit chi square higher. Any way, try to free R5 first (higher standardized residual for china), chi2 173.206. Then try to free R2 (higher raw and normalized residual for china; higher everything for us), chi2 177.161. To be honest, I do not understand why R5 impact more. Free both, leading to 166.697 (comapred to 162.492 in step 2). I would keep the final one (free both).

Add covariates would raise warnings,no matter it's adding one, two or three covariates. Also, the catigorical variable command do not fit here, many warnings (said only work when it's dependent variable).

### step 6:Explore partial invariance, if necessary.
By checking the MI in step 5 model, I found the RRS ON sec has a high MI. Then I free it.
Compared to step 4 model, this model is 1 df more, less than 3.84 chi2 increase. Meaning, the path from PCS to sec can be constrained to equal, the path from sec to RRS can not.
